Dite is a distributed intrusion detection system for
Linux 2.4.x based architectures.

It consists of two programs:

(1) Dite
    periodically gets the host system status (kernel & modules info,
    tcp/udp offered services, CRC for specified directory subtrees)
    and send it to Cocito, waiting for acknowledgement.

(2) Cocito
    receives host system status from Dite and compares it wih a previously
    stored one. On comparison error, it generates a
    syslog warning and replies to Dite with a negative acknowledgement.
